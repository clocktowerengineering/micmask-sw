sw for the mic mask project. hardware is tracked in a separate repo.

# about
one of the really cool things about the pandemic is how nobody wants to wear good masks, including elastomerics. the classic complaints about elastomerics in general are that they're hot and that communication sucks in them. i am working on how to solve hot, but communication is a shorter putt.

the overall project aims to utilize a stock esp8266 core along with a i2s mic and i2s amp driving a speaker; this can be mated with a housing that adapts to either a 3m bayonet fitting (currently designed and in work), a housing that adapts to a 3m secureclick, a housing that adapts to a honeywell, etc. this presently uses a esp8266 board, a i2s mic board, and a i2s amp board with speaker, but we aim to make a board that has all non esp8266 components and accepts a castellated 8266. this should allow us to get cost down to the <$20 range without much effort.
